### Welcome to the GitHub Pages of estebangm81
This page was created originally to display a really simple version of my CV, now moved to https://estebangm81.github.io/cv-en.html (English version). Do not expect rocket science... although it is a pure HTML5 page with CSS3 in three languages: Spanish, English and Italian and these pages pass W3C AAA accessibility guidelines and the CSS passes the accessiblity guidelines too.
